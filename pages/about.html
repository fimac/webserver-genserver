<h1>Clark's Wildthings Refuge</h1>

<blockquote>
  When we contemplate the whole globe as one great dewdrop, striped and dotted with continents and islands,
  flying through space with other stars all singing and shinging together as one,
  the whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beautry.
  -- John Muir
